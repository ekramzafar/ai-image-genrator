# üß© Used Pieces
This project leveraged Pieces for Developers to boost productivity and streamline development:

üîñ Snippet Management: Saved frequently used code like Express server setup, Replicate API fetch, and .env handling for quick access and reuse.

‚úçÔ∏è Prompt Storage: Managed a library of effective AI image prompts to test and iterate quickly.

üìù Development Notes: Captured backend setup steps, API keys handling tips, and debugging notes as Markdown for easy referencing.

ü§ñ Copilot Suggestions: Used Pieces Copilot to review and refactor parts of the backend, improving code clarity and safety.

ü§ù Team Sharing: Shared specific snippets and setup guides with collaborators directly via Pieces, saving time in coordination.

Pieces was like my personal dev memory during this project‚Äîstoring what matters, exactly when I needed it.


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
